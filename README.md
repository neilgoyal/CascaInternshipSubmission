# Casca Internship Submission

## **System Components**

1. **Data Ingestion Module**:
   - Accepts various types of bank statements (PDF, Excel, CSV) as input.
   - Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting text from scanned documents.

2. **Data Parsing and Cleaning**:
   - Parses the extracted text into structured data (date, description, debit, credit, balance).
   - Cleans and normalizes inconsistent formats across different bank statements.

3. **Insight Generation Module**:
   - Identifies monthly deposits, withdrawals, and recurring expenses (e.g., rent, utilities, salaries).
   - Detects outstanding loans and other liabilities.
   - Flags any suspicious or irregular activities.

4. **Machine Learning Component**:
   - Uses clustering to identify regular vs. irregular transactions.
   - Predicts financial stability and risk based on spending patterns and cash flow.

## **Technical Stack**

- **Frontend**: React.js for building an interactive dashboard.
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) for API services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL to store processed data and insights.
- **OCR**: Tesseract or AWS Textract for text extraction.
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy for data analysis and machine learning.

## **User Interface**

- **Upload Section**: Users can upload bank statements.
- **Dashboard**:
  - **Summary Section**: Monthly deposits, withdrawals, and net balance.
  - **Recurring Expenses**: A breakdown of regular payments.
  - **Loan Indicators**: Outstanding loans and liabilities.
  - **Risk Analysis**: A visual representation of financial risk.

## **Algorithmic Approach**

1. **Text Extraction**:
   - Use OCR to extract text from PDFs.
   - Preprocess the text to identify transaction lines.

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - Use regular expressions to extract relevant fields (date, description, debit, credit, balance).
   - Convert the structured data into a DataFrame for analysis.

3. **Insight Generation**:
   - Calculate monthly totals for deposits and withdrawals.
   - Identify recurring expenses using keyword matching.
   - Use clustering algorithms to flag unusual transactions.

4. **Risk Analysis**:
   - Build a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on historical data.
   - Calculate financial health scores based on cash flow patterns.

## **Edge Cases to Handle**

- Missing or incomplete data in statements.
- Different formats and currencies.
- Detection of fraudulent transactions.

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**

- **Accuracy**: How well the system identifies recurring expenses and outstanding loans.
- **Speed**: Time taken to process a bank statement and generate insights.
- **Usability**: Ease of use of the dashboard for bank staff.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Build a prototype of the OCR and parsing module.
2. Develop the backend API for processing and storing bank statement data.
3. Design the frontend dashboard.
4. Train a machine learning model for risk prediction.
5. Test the system with a variety of bank statements to ensure robustness.
